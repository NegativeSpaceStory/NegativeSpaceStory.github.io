title: Foreword

Upon learning what made my life "interesting", I was immediately *certain* that the story needed to be told. It had to happen. After all; this is the stuff good stories are made of. (Where did I get that idea?)

I would have to devise an ending before I knew the outcome -- what could a good ending for a story like mine be, anyway? I needed a way to make it tidy. Ideally it would be uplifting so it would be worth the difficult read, but... how? If I knew a good, uplifting ending for my story, wouldn't my life be so very different?

I found myself saying it out loud recently - probably in a recent writing: "I don't know why it feels important to tell this story; it just always has".

*The Primal Wound* quotes Harriet Mattigher as having said:

> One of the most common fears is that of being abandoned. Abandonment is a dominant theme in child myths.

The trend of absent parents in Disney stories and other, less commercialized fairy tales was almost certainly not lost on my subconscious mind. Perhaps it hurt too much to get cognizant of the fact that the common element among many children's stories was a thing that was also true about my life.

Yes: it is an interesting story which centers on my (weird) circumstances. I spent decades trying to figure out how to turn it into a product. It didn't matter if I earned currency by doing so: it was vital that I create an opportunity for other people to see it and nod approvingly saying things like *"yes, I see the humanity in this"* or *"indeed, this has given me insight which makes my own life just a bit easier"* or, most ideally: *"ahh; I will take this information and go forth in my life being a kinder person"*.

I was a deer in the headlights when my own mortality visited and, like so many other bullies, sent me sprawling on the floor before it with a violent shove from behind. The deadline (ha) was looming. Once again I found myself understudied, my brain swimming in poison soup, and the project - the most important (not-parenting related) one of my life - was still in the post-it note phase of development. (Academic trauma, anyone?)

This frantic fear wasn't entirely about my need to share my Art, tho.

(Although having Art left undone is a more-than-valid reason for panic: finding oneself suddenly able to see shape-and-color-level detail about the end of one's own life as it creeps closer from a difficult-to-measure distance is not an experience that can leave most people unaffected. Particularly unfair is the reality that tracking the position of a stalking Death in the effort to stay away from it is goddamn exhausting and distracting: it greedily steals focus from everything else we might need to be doing with our precious and ever fleeting remaining time.)

There was something else going on. I was aware of it but it was like the awareness was split or wedged between my conscious and subconscious. I could neither accept it at the core level nor get it in focus enough to make it useful.

I was hurting, but I couldn't recognize the pain as valid. I had this painful backstory, but it's like I didn't accept the facts of it as *having happened to me and therefore possibly the source of the pain*?! Reading The Book normalized my experience and gave me a "duh" moment so loud and resonant as to make the windows rattle. 

*I've been looking for mom since she left...*

Acknowledging this allows me to focus on accepting the truth of the matter: 

*...and she's not coming back.*

As nauseatingly hurtful as this may be to confront, it is vital to do so. It allows me to reclaim all the resouces I have been spending on trying to find her.

If one breaks a plate then glues it back together, although there should be a good “fit” because the same pieces are used, there is now glue separating the two parts. [...] In the case of adoption, not only does the plate have to be glued back together, but the other half of the plate is different, so that the pieces will not quite fit together. There is always a feeling of “not fitting.”

                                                                                                    — Verrier, The Primal Wound

Mom left because she couldn't keep me alive by herself. 

Later she died. 

I lost her at least twice (arguably more times than that). Each time, for one reason or another, I was explicitly denied the right to even just... feel sad about her loss, let alone to grieve it. I was told she wasn't my mom. That she shouldn't matter to me. That my "real" mom was the one who raised me. That I was being ungrateful for feeling hurt.

I assumed that those telling me not to grieve were well-meaning because I assumed that of everyone —but their dismissiveness was an intense and unforgivable form of cruelty. Their behavior was an act of selfish violence against an already injured baby.

In my trusting nature, I didn't consider that I could give myself permission to feel sad, or to honor my injury as valid. Doing so seemed like an insult to the people who had granted me the charity of caring for my basic needs in infancy and childhood.

According to The Book, my pain symptoms are not remotely unique among my demographic— they're not ever talked about because ~~everyone who hasn't been adopted~~ a huge chunk of society wants to believe and push the narrative that adoption is a perfect and tidy solution to a problem which is too painful to even acknowledege exists (let alone to live with).

I suppose the idea of telling my story represented hope that I could make myself worthy. If I turned that initial rejection into something of value, perhaps I could trade that value for a microscopic shred of uncorruptible reassurance that I deserve to live -- even though my birth mother's life was too shitty for her to keep me and care for me. 

Or.. geez:

Maybe the people who love and depend on me could also be okay without having to grieve my literal death on their path to safety?

Composing and sharing the story won't fix my plate. No person, living or dead, can replace what I've lost. There's no benevolent magician who can recognize my mother's ghost in my prose and be moved to reverse entropy. The only person who can recognize this loss for what it is and properly grieve it is me.

For sailors aboard ships in storms and high seas, the expression “Hold Fast” holds meaning of life and death. Whether one had the strength to maintain grip of the helm or rigging was decisive.

HOLD FAST as a tattoo is usually applied to the knuckles as a blessing to and a reminder that, whatever the hardships: hanging on is the definition of survival.

                                                             — Me (describing the history of the tattoo to someone who asked why I got it shortly before diagnosis)

One month ago, the sound of the windstorm raging in my head died down to a whispering breeze. Waves stopped slamming into the hull. The silence was deafening, and the contrast between states made me newly ill. 

Shortly thereafter, however, It became possible to be still for the first time in my life. I mean this as literally as possible while using a metaphor to describe it.

It turns out I hadn't been imagining the terrible conditions I was in, and my boat has never been on calm water before now. I know this because I finally know what calm waters look like and, as I have more or less always suspected: they are very different from what I was experiencing.

To be fair it was confusing for everyone: I couldn't figure out why the other boats seemed not to be getting tossed around as much as I was. They couldn't understand why I was in such distress when the weather seemed to be just fine.  

How did we all fail to notice that I was sailing in an entirely different Sea?

Fun realization as I conclude this part of the essay: the person who made it possible for me to finally read The Book, by way of a well-timed comment is named Storm.

I said something vaguely outlandish about what it would take for me to be able to read it, and without missing a beat, they said **maybe we can arrange it for you**. This was a shock-injection of 100% pure, industrial-grade kindness. It jumpstarted a processing sequence in my mind: Do I actually need that kind of help? Could I perhaps manage to do this by myself? Now? Yes? Ready? Okay? ...Fuck it. Let's go.

What maybe looked like a small act of basic humanity on their part had a massive impact. I won't soon forget it.

I stand now in astonishment: I almost died (several times) without having figured any of this out -- even as the source of my hurt stood in the middle of my life howling and demanding acknowledgement - every day - for literal decades. The answers were right in front of me. They were also available in book form. Just... how?

No; the pain isn't real. Just ignore it. It's not important. You had a mom that loved you. What more could you want?

The stories are mine. They are what I was handed in exchange for my wholeness and peace - a trade I never consented to make to begin with. As such: nothing less than wholeness restored (plus interest) amounts to a good trade, which renders them priceless artifacts.

They exist whether or not I describe them, and like the items I find and restore, they are often quirky and misshapen. Many bear signs of lovingly-executed repairs. They are refined and showcased by a lifetime spent discovering value in and creating beauty from that which is discarded. This is a practice which lies close to the core of me. It defines how I move through the world. It is the Art which I honor and live.

The stories permeate me. Traces of them are left on everything I touch. They sometimes emerge disguised as essays and artworks (which I may occasionally even complete).

While I have to continue to make and share these things, since I accept that this process is my Art and my Work, it no longer feels urgent that I offer justification for any of it. 

When I make gifts of my experiences by permitting their visibility, I can do so lightly --- without expectations of the people who might receive them directly or otherwise.

There is an unprecedented sense of safety, wholeness, and gratitude to hearing myself say (and believe) that I don't owe my story, or any other part of myself, to anyone. The truth of this stands with a few notable exceptions: namely three people for whom these stories are already written into their blood.

For better or worse, my history belongs to me. Through me it belongs to them. ❤️‍🩹
