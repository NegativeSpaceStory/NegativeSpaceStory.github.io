Upon learning my life was "interesting", I found myself surprisingly unsurprised by the news. More salient than any feeling of shock at what I was hearing was an immediate certainty that the story I was living needed telling. No question; this is the stuff good stories are *made of*. 

*The Primal Wound* quotes Harriet Mattigher:

> One of the most common fears is that of being abandoned. Abandonment is a dominant theme in child myths.

The trend of absent parents in fairy tales and Disney films was almost certainly not lost on my young subconscious mind. The common element shared among the stories I knew, as it turned out, was also true about me.

Judging by reactions of people I've told, it is at the very least an interesting story. I've tried, in almost every way imaginable, to package it for broader consumption. In more recent years, I began to wonder why I'd assigned myself such an arduous task."What makes it so urgently vital that I relive this experience? That I record it? That I share it?".

For a while I told myself it was a duty of sorts: that other people, having read the story, might then say things like *"I see the humanity in this."* or *"This has given me insights into my own life."* or, most hopefully: *"I will go forth and be a kinder person."*.

Such arguments for storytelling, compelling as they may have been, didn't seem to account for all or even most of my motivation. Even after dismissing the notion of "Good Damage", the need to share endured.

In various attempts to switch focus from reasoning to action, I concluded I would have to devise an ending before I knew the outcome. How could a story like mine end well, anyway? I would have to make it uplifting so as to be worth the difficult read. How could that even be possible?

*If I knew what an uplifting ending could look like, or indeed had any idea what I am moving towards, wouldn't my life be so very different?*

This unresolved question, paired with a worsening feeling that I was willing myself to grab a hot iron skillet to approach the topic let alone write about it, found me barricaded in from all sides with the worst imaginable case of writer's block.

Unsticking myself became ever more pressing in 2018 when my mortality paid a visit. Like so many bullies, it sent me sprawling on the floor before it with a violent shove. The deadline (ha) was looming, and in a conundrum which easily dwarfed my worst post-college nightmares, I found myself understudied and dysfunctional with angst and injury. The situation was beyond hope: the most important (not parenting-related) project of my life (and that which represented most of my grade) was both imminently due and firmly rooted in the post-it-note phase of development.

In an ensuing panic-fueled, chemo-intoxicated frenzy of grief and incapacity, I found myself paralyzed with overwhelm. Accepting that my various art projects would be left undone was among the heaviest truths to confront. Beyond the renewed hopelessness of finding an uplifting outcome to write towards, seeing the shape and color of Death as He crept towards me stole focus from the work I needed to cram into my remaining time.

Treatment forced me to accept some very real physical limiations of my body. At times I sprinted full speed into invisible barriers I'd never before encountered. People speak of the experience of cancer survival as though it grants one strength, and this is false. What it grants us is access to a degree of respect and humilty that is difficult to otherwise obtain.

Paradoxically empowered by a new awareness of my own feelings, I was able to take stock of my experience in the tenuous years since completing treatment. I became more and more suspicious of the possibility that I was living in some kind of constant pain. This represented a highly consequential shift in perspective since, if it was true, it meant that I *always had been*. 

I knew many details of my backstory, but for some reason I couldn't accept the stories I was told as *having happened to me*. It was as though the person who survived them had ceased to exist and I had been incarnated in their place. How could the events of someone else's early life be the source of my hurt? 

Nevertheless; the injury was there, and my awareness of it was divided across or perhaps wedged between my conscious and subconscious mind. I could neither integrate and manage it at a core level, nor could I deploy it to usefully direct my choices.

I experienced a sudden breakthrough at the end of 2024 when I learned that my experience of injury is not (by far) unique among adopted individuals. Quite suddenly my history integrated with a click so loud that I could swear the windows rattled:

*I've been looking for my mom since she left.*

That night my dreams told their own version:

> The light of a decades-awaited daybreak pierced the sky above the horizon and the ever-crashing waves of nausea sharply intensified. I saw myself standing upon the newly-illuminated landscape of my life. I was surrounded by the shrapnel of a thousand damaged connections. 

> My visibly abscessed core stood before me like a monument which had been secretly installed in the shadow of pre-dawn. Its representative form was towering, bulging, and central to everything I observed. It appeared strained: painfully vascularized, greenish, and swollen with infection. To my blossoming horror as I watched, it heaved slightly as though with labored breath. 

> At its base was affixed a deeply-engraved granite placard. Reading the inscription, I became aware that I'd already known what it said:

> **She's Not Coming Back.**

> The words newly entered my mind like a spell being cast and the sky split into a deafening crack of thunder. I recoiled from the sight of the words and for a moment I staggered, distressed and confused, in a small circle. "No." I weakly protested my condition and directed every internal resource towards stabilizing my weight over my feet. My fingertips searched and grazed the grip of a lance I'd been given by a friend.

> My field of view was like that of someone piloting an aircraft. and every warning light on the display briefly flickered. Some stayed illuminated. A remote siren blared in the East. The waves of physical discomfort hit with ever greater force while time itself seemed to stretch and twist. Without choosing to, I retreated deeper within my physical person as if to regroup. I retreated from nerve endings and nociceptors - away from external sights and screaming warnings. It was as though I was diving deep into the dark water of my own person. Was I dying?

> From my recessed place of rapidly-waning safety, I pivoted once more to align my fading vision through the tiny, distant windows of my eyes. The image of the central core swung into view under a flashing sky. Gathering the use of my limbs for a final, desperate, coarsely-timed, flailing burst of effort; I lunged at the towering abscess and extended my reach with the sharp end of the lance--

Before reading Verrier's book, a lonely, angry, unsupervised toddler rampaged within me. She spent her waking hours smashing buttons and throwing switches. Over time she was granted all the agency and faculties of an adult human complete with unhindered access to a wide variety of available resources.

Any glinting mirage of that baby's missing mother was the impetus to spend every resource we had (and many we didn't) on devastating shock-and-awe bids for acceptance. Failing these efforts (as was almost always the case), novelty-based anesthetics were a preferred survival strategy as we traversed the darkened, shell-shocked aftermath of relational disaster upon relational disaster.

> If one breaks a plate and glues it back together, although there should be a good “fit” because the same pieces are used, there is now glue separating the two parts. [...] In the case of adoption, not only does the plate have to be glued back together, but the other half of the plate is different, so that the pieces will not quite fit... There is always a feeling of “not fitting.”

—*Verrier, The Primal Wound*

In the often gruesome clarity of the post-dawn era of my life, I have observed the tendency of adults surrounding an adopted child to center their own fear and experience to the point of entirely overlooking that of the child they claim to care for. To say this will sound shocking to many and many still will deny that it happens. By contrast: my observation is that adoptees will almost unanimously cosign this claim.

Many adoptive parents seem eager to congratulate themselves for providing basic needs to a child they didn't create. Their peers eagerly assist in elevating this narrative. The message to the child they're raising is that their feelings of gratitude should be the unwavering default: gratitude for a situation no one would ever choose for themselves. 
Gratitude, perhaps, for not having been simply tossed in a dumpster. 

Something very noticeable to adoptees is that no such feelings of gratitude are seen as acceptable to demand of biological children.

Each time I lost my mother (it wasn't just once), I was explicitly and verbally denied the right to feel anything about her loss -- let alone to grieve it. 

I was delivered this message in all manner of cruel language. I was told the person who brought me to Earth wasn't my mom, that she was "worthless" anyway and I shouldn't care about her, that my connection to her was unimportant and it shouldn't matter that I'd lost it, that the worst thing that could happen to me would be turning out in any way to be like her, that my "real" mom was the person who raised me, that I was ungrateful for ever feeling the slightest bit hurt about her loss, and perhaps most unbearably; that I was perpetuating cruelty against my beloved adoptive mother just by admitting to my pain.

I assume that those guarding the site of my wound and telling me to search elsewhere for the source of the pain were well-meaning, but I realize, looking back, that I have a strange and self-harming tendency to assume good intentions of everyone I encounter regardless of their actual *behavior*.

More recently I've come to recognize the dismissiveness of the adults in my life as a selfish and particularly harmful form of cruelty: one they perpetuated against an already-injured *baby*. 

In my trust of them, I failed to consider that I could grant *myself* permission to honor the injury as valid. 

I never needed to wait until my life and soul were in tatters from trying and failing to repair my broken plate -- a condition made continually worse by ongoing attempts to fuse the half I was holding with every half-plate-shaped object I stumbled over. 

I didn't *have to* allow the infection of my core to persist into my fifth decade and render me nearly too weak and ill to treat it. 

I didn't *have to* narrowly survive a deadly disease and risk having lived my entire life never knowing a version of myself who understands what it means to integrate their primary trauma.

My experience of chronic pain (and being surrounded by chronic ignorance) is distressingly common among my demographic. The routine, devastating injuries of adopted children aren't often openly discussed because ~~everyone who hasn't been adopted~~ most of us want to believe that adoption is a tidy solution to a problem too painful to acknowledege exists (let alone to live with).

The infection of my core and the related hunt for acceptance and external validation more than adequately account for my drive to tell my story. It seems I reasoned that if I turned the initial rejection into something tangible, I could then perhaps trade the value I'd generated for a few crumbs of durable evidence that I deserve to live.

Perhaps my earnings would allow the people who love and depend on me to find their own safety without having to grieve my literal death along the way.

There's a bittersweet gratitude in noticing now that I never made much progress towards sharing the story before getting conscious of my motive and accepting that doing so won't repair my broken plate. 

There is no person on Earth to appeal to, and no cosmic entity in the universe that can or will reecognize my mother's ghost in my prose and be moved to restart time or reverse entropy.

The story I tell is what I was handed in exchange for wholeness and peace. This was a trade I never consented to make. Nothing less than wholeness restored (plus interest) represents an acceptable trade going forward. By that measurement, the story is a priceless artifact.

At the same time: it is me. It goes where I go. I leave leave traces of it on everything I touch. 

In my most recent decade, I took to caring for and preserving old furniture and decorative objects. I was taught by the tradesmen of my life to avoid aggressive intervention for these items wherever possible, but sometimes the things I find need a bit more than routine maintenance to stay whole or useful. Like my stories, they are pulled from rubble and arranged by hands which have spent a lifetime learning to extract beauty from that which is overlooked and discarded. 

This practice defines how I move through life. It is The Art which I honor and live. It is my sacred duty, and it no longer feels urgent to provide justification for doing this work.

If and when I choose to make a gift of my knowledge and experience by sharing it, I am able to do so lightly. I no longer have needs or expectations of the recipient(s), though of course I hope very much that they are left in better condition for having briefly glimpsed at life through my perspective, should they choose to.

I suppose this means self-acceptance has arrived. It is like a new wool sweater: uncomfortable and difficult to wear, yet entirely adequate for staying warm regardless of the weather. Having it in my toolkit, I am given to realize that I don't actually *owe* the story, or any other part of me, to anyone. 

The truth of this claim stands with a few notable exceptions. Namely; there are three people for whom the story is already written into their blood.

For better or worse, this history belongs to me. Through me it belongs to them.
