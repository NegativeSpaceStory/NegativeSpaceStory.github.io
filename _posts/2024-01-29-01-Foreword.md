Upon learning what made my life "interesting", I was immediately convinced it was a story that needed to be told. No question about it; this is the stuff good stories are *made of* -- but where did I get that idea?

*The Primal Wound* quotes Harriet Mattigher:

> One of the most common fears is that of being abandoned. Abandonment is a dominant theme in child myths.

The trend of absent parents in fairy tales and Disney films was almost certainly not lost on my young subconscious mind. Somehow it remained remote and inaccessible that the common element among the stories I knew was also true about me.

Judging by reactions of the people I've told it to, it is at the very least an interesting story. I've spent most of my life trying to find a way to package it for consumption - but why? What made it so urgently vital that I might create an opportunity for others people to experience the world through my lens? 

Perhaps they would say things like *"yes, I see the humanity in this"* or *"indeed, this has given me insight which makes greater sense of life"* or, most hopefully: *"yes; I will take this experience and go forth in my own life being a kinder person"*.

This argument for storytelling, compelling as it was, didn't seem to account for all of my motivation.

Turning focus from reasoning to action, it seemed I would have to devise an ending before I knew the outcome. How could a story like mine end well, anyway? I would have to find a way to make it uplifting so as to be worth a difficult read. ...but how would that even be possible?

*If I knew what an uplifting ending could look like, or indeed had any idea what I am moving towards, wouldn't my life be so very different?*


These questions became all the more pressing when, in 2018, my mortality paid a visit. Like so many bullies it sent me sprawling on the floor before it with a violent shove. The deadline (ha) was looming. Easily dwarfing my worst post-college nightmares, I found myself understudied, my brain dysfunctional with angst and injury, and the project -- the most important (not-parenting related) project of my life and that which represented most of my grade -- imminently due yet still in the post-it note phase of development.

My fear wasn't entirely about the need to share art, though having art left undone is a more-than-valid reason for panic. Being able to see the shape and color of Death as He creeps towards us from poorly-judged distances is not an experience that can leave a person unaffected. Avoiding a sleepless persistence-hunter is exhausting and overwhelmingly distracting. Greedily it steals focus from everything we might need to be doing with our precious remaining time. 

Still the need to share the story remained not-fully accounted-for.

Taking stock of the situation in the tenuous years since, I became aware that I was hurting. Not only was I in pain, but I always *had been*. 

It seemed I couldn't fully recognize the pain as valid. My awareness of it was divided or perhaps wedged between my conscious and subconscious mind. I could neither fully experience it at the core level, nor could I seem to get it in focus enough to allow it to direct my choices.

I knew many details of my backstory, but I couldn't accept the stories I was told as *having happened to me* -- the person who survived them had ceased to exist and I was incarnated in their place. How could the events of someone else's early life be the source of *my* hurt? 

I experienced a massive breakthrough at the end of 2024 when I learned that my experience of injury is not remotely unique among adopted individuals. It was in that moment that I became able to integrate my history as being my own. The result was a click so loud and resonant that I could swear the windows rattled:

*I've been looking for Mom since she left.*

That night my dreams told a story:

The light of a decades-awaited daybreak pierced the sky above the horizon and the ever-crashing waves of nausea sharply intensified. I saw myself standing upon the newly-illuminated landscape of my life surrounded by shrapnel of a thousand damaged connections. 

My visibly abscessed core stood before me like a monument which had been invisibly installed in the shadow of pre-dawn. Its representative form was towering, bulging, and central to everything I observed. It appeared strained: painfully vascularized, greenish, swollen with infection. To my continued horror, it heaved slightly as though with labored breath. 

At its base was affixed a deeply-engraved granite placard. Reading the inscription, I became aware that I'd already known what it said:

*She's Not Coming Back.*

As the words newly entered my mind, the sky split into a terrifying crack of thunder and I reeled backwards. For a moment I staggered, distressed and confused, in a small circle. "No." I mumbled almost drunkenly as I redirected every internal resource towards stabilizing myself and facing the injury. My fingertips searched and grazed the grip of the lance I'd been given by a friend for specifically this journey.

My vision was like that of someone piloting an aircraft, and every warning light flickered in the display. Some stayed on. A remote siren blared in the East. The waves of nausea landed with ever greater force and time itself seemed to stretch and twist. As though reflexively, I retreated deeper within my physical self: away from the nerve endings and nociceptors - away from external sights and screaming warnings as though diving deeper into dark waters. Was I dying?

From deep within my body, in my place of rapidly-waning safety, I turned to align my remaining consciousness through the tiny, distant windows of my eyes such that the image of the still-pulsating central core swung into view under the flashing sky. Gathering the use of my limbs for one desperate, coarsely-timed, flailing burst of effort, I lunged at the towering abscess with the sharpened end of my lance...

Before reading Verrier's book, there had been an unlocated drain siphoning off my personal power always at least slightly faster than I could generate it. A lonely, unattended toddler rampaged inside my person. Over time she was granted all the agency and faculties of an adult complete with unhindered access to a wide variety of available physical resources.

Any glinting mirage of that baby's missing mother was a valid impetus to spend every resource we had (and many we didn't) on devastating shock-and-awe bids for acceptance. Failing such efforts (as was almost always the case), novelty-based anesthetics were a preferred survival strategy as we traversed the shell-shocked aftermath.

> If one breaks a plate and glues it back together, although there should be a good “fit” because the same pieces are used, there is now glue separating the two parts. [...] In the case of adoption, not only does the plate have to be glued back together, but the other half of the plate is different, so that the pieces will not quite fit... There is always a feeling of “not fitting.”

—*Verrier, The Primal Wound*

In the clarity of daybreak, I have observed the tendency of adults surrounding an adopted child to center their own fear and experience to the point of entirely overlooking that of the child they claim to care for. 

Many of them seem very eager to congratulate themselves for providing basic needs to a child they didn't create. Such behavior is extremely common among adoptive parents and those immediately adjacent. The message to the child they're raising is always that gratitude should be an unwavering default: gratitude for a situation no one ever choose for themselves. ...gratitude for not having been simply tossed in a dumpster. 

And by contrast, and something very noticeable to adoptees, is that no such feelings of gratitude are seen as acceptable to demand of biological children.

Each time I lost my mother (it wasn't just once), I was explicitly and verbally denied the right to feel anything about her loss let alone to grieve it. 

I was told that the person who brought me to Earth wasn't my mom, that she was worthless anyway and I shouldn't care about her, that my connection to her was unimportant and shouldn't matter to me to have lost it, that the worst thing that could happen to me would be turning out in any way to be like her, that my "real" mom was the person who raised me, that I was ungrateful for ever feeling the slightest bit hurt about the loss of my primary biological connection, and most unbearably; that I was perpetuating cruelty against my beloved adopted mother if I ever admitted to my own pain.

I assume that those telling me to search elsewhere for the source of my hurt were well-meaning. In fact I tend to assume good intentions of everyone. 

Recently I've come to recognize their dismissiveness as a selfish and particularly harmful form of cruelty, which they perpetuated against an already-injured *baby*.

In trusting them, I failed to consider that I could grant *myself* permission to feel sad or to honor my injury as valid. I never needed to wait until my life and soul were in tatters. I didn't have to allow the infection of my core to persist and render me all but too deliriously ill to treat it. I didn't have to narrowly survive a deadly disease and risk having lived my entire life never knowing the version of myself who understands what it means to integrate their trauma.

My experience of chronic pain (and being surrounded by chronic ignorance) is distressingly common among my demographic. As a society the routine injuries of adopted children aren't talked about openly because ~~everyone who hasn't been adopted~~ most of us want to believe that adoption is a tidy solution to a problem too painful to acknowledege exists (let alone live with).

The infected core and related hunt for acceptance explain much of the drive to tell the story: if I could turn my initial rejection into something tangible, perhaps I could trade the value I'd generated in doing so for a microscopic shred of resilient reassurance that I deserve to live.

Perhaps that would allow the people who love and depend on me to find their own safety without having to grieve my literal death along the way.

There's a bittersweet gratitude that I never made much progress in the effort to share these stories before getting conscious of my motives and accepting that doing this work won't repair my broken plate. 

There is no person on Earth I can appeal to, and no cosmic entity in the universe that can reecognize my mother's ghost in the prose and be moved to restart time or reverse entropy.

There is one perspective in the universe which can see and grieve this loss for all that it is. There is only one who can fully understand and validate any part of the pain of it.

The story is what I was handed in exchange for wholeness and peace. This was a trade I never consented to make. Nothing less than wholeness restored (plus interest) represents an acceptable trade going forward. By that measurement, the story is a priceless artifact.

...and it is me. It is who I am. It goes where I go. I leave leave traces of it on everything I touch. 

Particularly over the last decade of my life, I have taken to caring for and preserving old furniture and decorative objects. I was taught by the tradesmen of my life to avoid aggressive intervention wherever possible, but sometimes these items need a bit more than routine maintenance to stay useful. Like my stories, they are pulled from rubble and arranged by hands which have spent a lifetime learning to extract beauty from that which is overlooked and discarded. 

This practice defines how I move through life. It is the Art which I honor and live. It is my sacred duty, and it no longer feels urgent to provide justification for doing it.

If I choose to make a gift of my experience by sharing it, I can do so lightly. I have no needs or expectations of the recipient, though of course I hope they are better for the experience of briefly sharing my perspective.

Self-acceptance has finally arrived, and it is, as promised, fully sufficient. From this place I am given to realize that I don't owe this story, or any other part of me, to anyone. 

The truth of this claim stands with a few notable exceptions. Namely; there are three people for whom the story is already written into their blood.

For better or worse, this history belongs to me. Through me it belongs to them.
