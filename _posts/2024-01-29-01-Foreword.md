Upon learning what made my life "interesting", I was immediately convinced that the story needed to be told. It had to happen. This is the stuff good stories are made of. 

(Where did I get that idea?)

It seemed I would have to devise an ending before I knew the outcome -- what could a good ending for a story like mine be, anyway? I needed a way to make it tidy. It should be uplifting so as to be worth a difficult read, but how? 

*If I knew a good, uplifting ending for my story, or had any idea what I was moving towards, wouldn't my life be so very different?*

I found myself explaining it to someone recently: "I don't know why it feels important to tell the story; it just always has".

*The Primal Wound* quotes Harriet Mattigher:

> One of the most common fears is that of being abandoned. Abandonment is a dominant theme in child myths.

The trend of absent parents in fairy tales and Disney was almost certainly not lost on my  subconscious young mind. For whatever reason it never clicked into place that the common element among many children's stories was a thing that was also true about me.

Yes: it is an interesting story, and it centers on circumstances that are too strange to be fiction. I spent decades trying to figure out how to turn what I've lived into a product. It didn't matter if I earned currency for it: it felt vital that I create an opportunity for other people to consume it and nod approvingly. Maybe they would say things like *"yes, I see the humanity in this"* or *"indeed, this has given me insight which makes my own life just a bit easier"* or, best of all: *"ahh; I will take this information and go forth in my life being a kinder person"*.

I was a deer in the headlights when mortality visited 6 years ago and, like so many other bullies, sent me sprawling on the floor before it with a violent shove from behind. The deadline (ha) was looming. Easily besting all of my post-college nightmares, I found myself understudied, my brain dysfunctional and swimming in poison soup, and the project - the most important (not-parenting related) one of my life - still in the post-it note phase of development.

My fear wasn't entirely about my need to share art, though having art left undone is a more-than-valid reason for panic (Being able to see the shape and color of Death as He creeps closer from a poorly-judged distance is not an experience that can leave one unaffected. Avoiding a sleepless persistence-hunter is exhausting and overwhelmingly distracting: it greedily steals focus from anything else we might need to be doing with our precious and ever fleeting remaining time). As if that weren't enough, there was far more to my sense of urgency.

I had an awareness of what it was, but that awareness was divided or wedged between conscious and subconscious mind. I could neither accept it at the core level, nor could I get it in focus enough to make it useful.

I was hurting and I always had been, but I couldn't recognize the pain as valid. I had my incredibly fraught backstory, but I couldn't quite accept the facts of it as *having happened to me*, so how could it possibly be the source of the hurt? 

Learning that my condition of injury is not unique among adopted individuals suddenly normalized the entirety of my experience. The result was a "duh" moment so loud and resonant that I swear the windows rattled.

*I've been looking for Mom since she left...* 

The sharp, gruesome light of this decades-awaited daybreak spilled over the horizon on Christmas Day of the previous year. It cast itself over the disaster which has been my existence until that moment. 

A monument, which had been invisibly erected in the shadows of the pre-dawn era, suddenly stood fully-visible in unsettling detail. Blinking, I slowly approached this towering horror and squinted to read a deeply-engraved granite placard at its base.

*She's Not Coming Back.*

Nauseating as the landscape and its features have been to confront, it has been vitally important (and badly overdue). 

My personal power was being endlessly drained: spent dry by a toddler empowered with the faculties of an adult and unfettered access to the whole account. Any mirage or scent hinting at possibly repairing my maternal connection was the impetus to spend every resource we had (and many we didn't) on bus tickets, ornamentation, craft supplies, warmly inviting spaces - whatever was necessary to provide dopamine or perhaps attract attention so that could then prove my worth.

> If one breaks a plate and glues it back together, although there should be a good “fit” because the same pieces are used, there is now glue separating the two parts. [...] In the case of adoption, not only does the plate have to be glued back together, but the other half of the plate is different, so that the pieces will not quite fit... There is always a feeling of “not fitting.”

—*Verrier, The Primal Wound*

My mother left because she didn't have the resources, internal or external, to keep me safe. 

Later she died. 

I lost her at least twice (but arguably many more times than that). 

I have learned in recent days that the tendency of adults surrounding an adopted child to center their experience and laud their own virtuousnes for providing basic needs to a child they didn't create is not limited to my experience. Each time I lost my mother, I was explicitly denied the right to feel sad about her loss, let alone grieve it. 

I was told she wasn't my mom, that my connection to her shouldn't matter to me, that my "real" mom was the person who raised me, that I was ungrateful for feeling hurt about the severed connection and loss, and most unbearably, that I would hurt my adopted mother by admitting to my own pain.

I assume that those telling me not to grieve were well-meaning because I tend to assume this of everyone. I've since come to recognize their dismissiveness as an act of selfish violence against an injured baby.

In trusting them, I failed to consider that I could grant myself permission to feel sad or to honor my injury as valid. After all, wasn't I just expressing a lack of gratitude for all the charity I had received in place of having simply been tossed in a dumpster? 

My experience of chronic pain and being surrounded by chronic ignorance is not remotely unique among the other members of my demographic. It's never talked about much, because ~~everyone who hasn't been adopted~~ a huge chunk of society wants to believe and push the narrative that adoption is a tidy solution to a problem which is too painful to even acknowledege exists (let alone to live with).

I realize now that the act of telling my story represented hope that I could make myself worthy. If I turned that initial rejection into something of value, perhaps I could trade that value for a microscopic shred of uncorruptible reassurance that I deserve to live and have my experience count as valid -- even though my birth mother's conditions were too harsh for her to keep me and care for me. 

Or even that the people who love and depend on me could themselves be okay without having to grieve my literal death on their own individual pathways to safety?

Composing and sharing my story won't fix my plate. No person, living or dead, can replace what has been lost. There's no savior or available magical being to recognize my mother's ghost in my prose and be moved to reverse entropy. The only person who can see this loss for what it is and properly grieve it is me. 

> For sailors aboard ships in storms, the expression “Hold Fast” holds meaning of life and death. Whether one had the strength to maintain grip of the helm or rigging was decisive.

> HOLD FAST as a tattoo is usually applied to the knuckles as a blessing to and a reminder that, whatever the hardships: hanging on is the definition of survival.

- *Unknown* 

Last Christmas, the sound of a raging windstorm died down to a whispering breeze. Waves ceased slamming into the hull of my boat. The ringing in my ears lasted for days, and the contrast between states made me newly ill. 

Within a week or two, it became possible to be still for the first time in my life. I mean this as literally as possible while using a metaphor to describe it.

Now that I know what calm water looks like, I am able to better understand what came before: I hadn't been imagining the conditions. I wasn't wrong that my situation was abnormally bad and that I was holding on for dear life the whole time. I couldn't figure out why the other boats seemed not to be getting tossed around as much as I was. They couldn't understand why I was in such distress when the weather seemed to be just fine. 

Somehow we all failed to notice that I was sailing in an entirely different Sea.

I want to pay a moment's gratitude to the person who made it possible for me to finally scrutinize my adoption as a possible source of my pain. It happened by way of a well-timed, unexpectedly kind comment from a friend named Storm. What maybe would appear as a small act of basic humanity on their part had a massive impact.

---

Looking back threatens to steal focus. I almost died (several times) without ever experiencing calm water: even as the source of hurt stood in the middle of my life howling and thrashing every day for literal decades. The answers were right in front of me. They were also available in book form.

An important realization derived from this change is that these stories are mine. They are what I was handed in exchange for wholeness and peace in a trade I never consented to make. Nothing less than wholeness restored (plus interest) amounts to a good trade. In conclusion, they are priceless artifacts.

They exist and are real whether or not I acknowledge or describe them them. 

The following stories are me. I leave traces of them on everything I touch. 

Like the antique objects I find and restore; they tend to be quirky and misshapen. Many bear signs of lovingly-executed repairs which at the same time take care to preserve as much of the original material and appearance as possible. They are pulled from rubble and arranged by hands which have spent a lifetime extracting beauty from that which is discarded. 

This is the practice which lies close to the core of me. It defines how I move through the world. It is the Art which I honor and live. I accept this process as my sacred duty, and it no longer feels urgent that I offer justification for it. 

There is an unprecedented sense of safety, wholeness, and gratitude to hearing myself say (and believe) that I don't owe the stories, or any other part of me, to anyone, but the truth of this stands with a few notable exceptions: namely three people for whom these stories are already written into their blood.

For better or worse, this history belongs to me. Through me it belongs to them. ❤️‍🩹
