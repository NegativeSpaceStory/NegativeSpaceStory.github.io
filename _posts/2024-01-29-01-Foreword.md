Upon learning what made my life "interesting", I was immediately certain that as a story it needed to be told. No question about it; this is the stuff good stories are *made of* -- but where did I get that idea?

*The Primal Wound* quotes Harriet Mattigher:

> One of the most common fears is that of being abandoned. Abandonment is a dominant theme in child myths.

The trend of absent parents in fairy tales and Disney films was almost certainly not lost on my young subconscious mind. Somehow I remained not fully conscious of the fact that the common element among most of the stories I knew was also something true about me.

Judging by reactions of people I've told it to, it is at the very least an interesting story. I've tried, in almost every way imaginable, to package it for consumption - but why? What made it so urgently vital that I record this experience? 

Perhaps other people, having read the story, would say things like *"yes, I see the humanity in this"* or *"indeed, this has given me insight into my own life"* or, most hopefully: *"having read this, I will go forth into my own life being a kinder person"*.

This argument for the storytelling, compelling as it was, didn't seem to account for all or even most of my motivation.

Turning focus from reasoning to action, it seemed I would have to devise an ending before I knew the outcome. How could a story like mine end well, anyway? I would have to find a way to make it uplifting so as to be worth the difficult read. ...but how might that even be possible?

*If I knew what an uplifting ending could look like, or indeed had any idea what I am moving towards, wouldn't my life be so very different?*

These questions became all the more pressing when, in 2018, mortality paid me a visit. Like so many bullies it sent me sprawling on the floor before it with a violent shove. The deadline (ha) was looming. Easily dwarfing my worst post-college nightmares, I found myself understudied, my brain dysfunctional with angst and injury, and the project -- the most important (not-parenting related) project of my life and that which represented most of my grade -- imminently due but still firmly in the post-it note phase of development.

It was at this time I became aware that my fear of running out of time wasn't entirely about the need to share art, though having art left undone is a more-than-valid reason for panic. Being able to see the shape and color of Death as He creeps towards us from poorly-judged distances is not an experience that can leave a person unaffected. Avoiding a sleepless persistence-hunter is exhausting and overwhelmingly distracting. Greedily, it steals focus from everything we might need to be doing with our precious remaining time. 

Still the intense, gnawing need to share the story remained not-fully understood or accounted-for.

Taking stock of my experience in the tenuous years since, I became more suspicious of the possibility that I was in some kind of constant pain. This was a seriously consequential shift in perspective: if it was true, it meant that I *always had been*. 

I knew many details of my backstory, but I couldn't accept the stories I was told as *having happened to me* -- the person who survived them had ceased to exist and I was incarnated in their place. How could the events of someone else's early life be the source of *my* hurt? 

As such, I couldn't recognize the related pain as valid. My awareness of it was divided or perhaps wedged between my conscious and subconscious mind. I could neither integrate and manage it at the core level, nor could I seem to get it in focus enough to allow it to usefully direct my choices.

I experienced a massive breakthrough at the end of 2024 when I learned that my experience of injury is not remotely unique among adopted individuals. Suddenly my own history integrated with a click so loud that I could swear the windows rattled:

*I've been looking for Mom since she left.*

That night my dreams told their version of the story:

The light of a decades-awaited daybreak pierced the sky above the horizon and the ever-crashing waves of nausea sharply intensified. I saw myself standing upon the newly-illuminated landscape of my life. I was surrounded by the shrapnel of a thousand damaged connections. 

My visibly abscessed core stood before me like a monument which had been secretly installed in the shadow of pre-dawn. Its representative form was towering, bulging, and central to everything I observed. It appeared strained: painfully vascularized, greenish, and swollen with infection. To my blossoming horror as I watched, it heaved slightly as though with labored breath. 

At its base was affixed a deeply-engraved granite placard. Reading the inscription, I became aware that I'd already known what it said:

*She's Not Coming Back.*

The words newly entered my mind like a spell that was cast and the sky was split by a deafening crack of thunder. I recoiled from the sight of the words and for a moment I staggered, distressed and confused, in a small circle. "No." I mumbled almost drunkenly. I redirected every internal resource towards stabilizing myself and facing the grotesque horror and source of my pain before me. My fingertips searched and grazed the grip of a lance I'd been given by a friend.

My vision was like that of someone piloting an aircraft: every warning light flickered upon the display and some stayed illuminated. A remote siren blared in the East. The waves of nausea hit with ever greater force and time itself seemed to stretch and twist. I retreated deeper within my physical self to regroup: away from nerve endings and nociceptors - away from external sights and screaming warnings as though diving deep into dark water. Was I dying?

From the recessed location within my body, in a place of rapidly-waning safety, I turned back to align my remaining vision through the tiny, distant windows of my eyes such that the image of the still-pulsating central core swung into view under the flashing sky. Gathering the use of my limbs for one desperate, coarsely-timed, flailing burst of effort, I lunged at the towering abscess, extending my reach with the sharp end of my lance--

Before reading Verrier's book, a lonely, unsupervised toddler rampaged inside my person. She spent her waking hours smashing buttons and throwing switches. Over time she was granted all the agency and faculties of an adult human complete with unhindered access to a wide variety of available resources.

Any glinting mirage of that baby's missing mother was the impetus to spend every resource we had (and many we didn't) on devastating shock-and-awe bids for acceptance. Failing such efforts (as was almost always the case), novelty-based anesthetics were a preferred survival strategy as together we traversed the darkened, shell-shocked aftermath of relational disaster upon relational disaster.

> If one breaks a plate and glues it back together, although there should be a good “fit” because the same pieces are used, there is now glue separating the two parts. [...] In the case of adoption, not only does the plate have to be glued back together, but the other half of the plate is different, so that the pieces will not quite fit... There is always a feeling of “not fitting.”

—*Verrier, The Primal Wound*

In my newly discovered clarity, I have observed the tendency of adults surrounding an adopted child to center their own fear and experience to the point of entirely overlooking that of the child they claim to care for. It is a shocking thing to proclaim and many will deny it happens, yet adoptees unanimously agree that it is very much A Thing.

Many adoptive parents seem eager to congratulate themselves for providing basic needs to a child they didn't create, and their peers help by elevating this narrative. The message to the child they're raising is that their feelings of gratitude should be the unwavering default -- gratitude for a situation no one would ever choose for themselves -- gratitude for not having been simply tossed in a dumpster. 

And by contrast is something very noticeable to adoptees: no such feelings of gratitude are seen as acceptable to demand of biological children.

Each time I lost my mother (it wasn't just once), I was explicitly and verbally denied the right to feel anything about her loss -- let alone to grieve it. 

I was told this in all manner of cruel language: that the person who brought me to Earth wasn't my mom, that she was worthless anyway and I shouldn't care about her, that my connection to her was unimportant and it shouldn't matter that I'd lost it, that the worst thing that could happen to me would be turning out in any way to be like her, that my "real" mom was the person who raised me, that I was ungrateful for ever feeling the slightest bit hurt about the loss of my primary biological connection, and perhaps most unbearably; that I was perpetuating cruelty against my beloved adoptive mother if I ever so much as admitted to my pain.

I assume that those telling me to search elsewhere for the source of my hurt were well-meaning, but I realize, looking back, that I have a self-harming tendency to assume good intentions of everyone I encounter.

Recently I've come to recognize the dismissiveness of the adults in my life as a selfish and particularly harmful form of cruelty and one they perpetuated against an already-injured *baby*. 

In my trust of them, I failed to consider that I could grant *myself* permission to feel sad and to honor my injury as valid. I never needed to wait until my life and soul were in tatters from trying and failing to repair my broken plate -- a condition continually made wore by my attempts to fuse the half I was holding with every half-plate-shaped object I stumbled over. 

I didn't have to allow the infection of my core to persist into my fifth decade and render me nearly too weak and ill to treat it. 

I didn't have to narrowly survive a deadly disease and risk having lived my entire life never knowing a version of myself who understands what it means to integrate their primary trauma.

My experience of chronic pain (and being surrounded by chronic ignorance) is distressingly common among my demographic. The routine injuries of adopted children aren't talked about openly because ~~everyone who hasn't been adopted~~ most of us want to believe that adoption is a tidy solution to a problem too painful to acknowledege exists (let alone live with).

The infected core and related hunt for acceptance and external validation more than adequately account for my drive to tell the story. It seems I reasoned that I might turn my initial rejection into something tangible, and then perhaps I could trade the value I'd generated in doing so for a few crumbs of durable evidence that I deserve to live.

Perhaps doing so would allow the people who love and depend on me to find their own safety without having to grieve my literal death along the way.

There's a bittersweet gratitude I experience in noticing now that I never made much progress towards sharing the story before getting conscious of my motive and accepting that doing so won't repair the broken plate. 

There is no person on Earth I can appeal to, and no cosmic entity in the universe that can or will reecognize my mother's ghost in my prose and be moved to restart time or reverse entropy.

The story is what I was handed in exchange for wholeness and peace. This was a trade I never consented to make. Nothing less than wholeness restored (plus interest) represents an acceptable trade going forward. By that measurement, the story is a priceless artifact.

At the same time: it is me. It goes where I go. I leave leave traces of it on everything I touch. 

Particularly over the last decade of my life, I have taken to caring for and preserving old furniture and decorative objects. I was taught by the tradesmen of my life to avoid aggressive intervention wherever possible, but sometimes these items need a bit more than routine maintenance to stay useful. Like my stories, they are pulled from rubble and arranged by hands which have spent a lifetime learning to extract beauty from that which is overlooked and discarded. 

This practice defines how I move through life. It is the Art which I honor and live. It is my sacred duty, and it no longer feels urgent to provide justification for doing it.

If and when I choose to make a gift of experience by sharing it, I am able to do so lightly. I have no needs or expectations of the recipient, though of course I hope very much that they are left in better condition for having briefly shared my perspective.

Self-acceptance has arrived. It is as sufficient as it was promised to be by those who tried to explain what it as. From this place I am given to realize that I don't owe my story, or any other part of me, to anyone. 

The truth of this claim stands with a few notable exceptions. Namely; there are three people for whom the story is already written into their blood.

For better or worse, this history belongs to me. Through me it belongs to them.
