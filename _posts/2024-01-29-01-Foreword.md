Upon learning what made my life "interesting", I was immediately convinced it was a story that needed to be told. It had to happen. This is the stuff good stories are *made of* -- but where did I get that idea?

It seemed I would have to devise an ending before I knew the outcome, and how could my story end well, anyway? It should be uplifting so as to be worth a difficult read, but how? 

*If I knew an uplifting ending for my story, or indeed had any idea what I was moving towards, wouldn't my life be so very different?*

*The Primal Wound* quotes Harriet Mattigher:

> One of the most common fears is that of being abandoned. Abandonment is a dominant theme in child myths.

The trend of absent parents in fairy tales and Disney films was almost certainly not lost on my young subconscious mind, but it didn't fully click that the common element among many children's stories was a thing that was also true about me.

Yes: it is an interesting story, judging by the reactions of everyone I've told it to, and it centers on circumstances that are too strange to be fiction. I spent lots of time trying to turn what I've lived into a product. It was never about profit; it was simply and urgently vital that I create an opportunity for others people to experience it. Maybe they would say things like *"yes, I see the humanity in this"* or *"indeed, this has given me insight which makes greater sense of life"* or, best of all: *"yes; I will take this experience and go forth in my own life being a kinder person"*.

I was a deer in the headlights when mortality knocked on my front door 6 years ago. Like so many other bullies it sent me sprawling on the floor before it with a violent shove from behind. The deadline (ha) was looming. Easily dwarfing my post-college nightmares, I found myself understudied, my brain dysfunctional with angst and injury, and the project - the most important (not-parenting related) one of my life - imminently due while still in the post-it note phase of development.

The fear wasn't entirely about the need to share art, though having art left undone is a more-than-valid reason for such panic Being able to see the shape and color of Death as He creeps closer from a poorly-judged distances is not an experience that can leave one unaffected. Avoiding a sleepless persistence-hunter is overwhelmingly distracting, and it greedily steals focus from everything else we might need to be doing with our precious remaining time. Still: there was more to this sense of urgency.

My awareness of it was divided or perhaps wedged between my conscious and subconscious mind. I could neither accept it at the core level, nor could I seem to get it in focus enough to make it useful.

I was hurting. I always had been, but I couldn't recognize the pain as valid. I knew the details of my incredibly fraught backstory, but I couldn't quite accept it as *having happened to me*. How could it possibly be the source of the hurt? 

Learning that my condition of injury is not, by far, unique among adopted individuals suddenly normalized the entirety of my experience. The result was a "duh" moment so loud and resonant that I swear the windows rattled.

*I've been looking for Mom since she left...* 

The sharp, gruesome light of this decades-awaited daybreak spilled blindingly over my horizons on Christmas Day of the previous year. It cast itself over the disaster which has been my existence until that moment. 

A central monument, which had been invisibly erected in the early shadows of the pre-dawn era, suddenly stood fully-visible in unsettling detail. Blinking, I slowly approached the towering horror of it and squinted to read a deeply-engraved granite placard set at its base.

*She's Not Coming Back.*

Nauseating as the surrounding landscape and its features have been to confront, it was vitally important (and severely overdue). I now recognize that my resources were being drained by a toddler empowered with the faculties of an adult and unfettered access to the whole account. Any mirage or scent hinting at a possibility of repairing my maternal connection was the impetus to spend every resource we had (and many we didn't) on bus tickets, ornamentation, craft supplies, or warm and inviting spaces - whatever was necessary to gloss over the hurt or give means to prove worth.

> If one breaks a plate and glues it back together, although there should be a good “fit” because the same pieces are used, there is now glue separating the two parts. [...] In the case of adoption, not only does the plate have to be glued back together, but the other half of the plate is different, so that the pieces will not quite fit... There is always a feeling of “not fitting.”

—*Verrier, The Primal Wound*

My mother left because she didn't have the resources, internal or external, to keep me safe. 

Later she died. 

I lost her at least twice (though arguably many more times than that). 

I have learned in recent days that there is a tendency of the adults surrounding an adopted child to center their experience. Many of them congratulate themselves for providing basic needs to a child they didn't create, and this behavior is extremely, extremely common. The message to the child they're raising is always that gratitude should always and forever come first: gratitude for a situation no one would ever have chosen in the first place.  ...for not having been simply tossed in the garbage.

Each time I lost my mother, I was explicitly, verbally, denied the right to feel sad about her loss, let alone to grieve it. 

I was told the person who brought me to Earth wasn't my mom, that my connection to her shouldn't matter to me, that my "real" mom was the person who raised me, that I was ungrateful for feeling hurt about the loss of her, and most unbearably; that I would unfairly hurt my adopted mother if I ever admitted to my own pain.

I assume that those telling me not to grieve were well-meaning. I tend to assume this of everyone and fail to question it, but I've recently come to recognize the dismissiveness they displayed as an act of selfish violence against an injured baby.

In trusting them, I failed to consider that I could grant *myself* permission to feel sad or to honor my injury as valid.

My experience of chronic pain and being surrounded by chronic ignorance is not remotely unique among the other members of my demographic. It's never talked about much, because ~~everyone who hasn't been adopted~~ a huge chunk of society wants to believe and push the narrative that adoption is a tidy solution to a problem which is too painful to even acknowledege exists (let alone to live with).

I realize now that the act of telling my story represented hope that I could make myself worthy. If I turned that initial rejection into something of value, perhaps I could trade that value for a microscopic shred of uncorruptible reassurance that I deserve to live and have my experience count as valid -- even though my birth mother's conditions were too harsh for her to keep me and care for me. 

Or even that the people who love and depend on me could themselves be okay without having to grieve my literal death on their own individual pathways to safety?

Composing and sharing my story won't fix my plate. No person, living or dead, can replace what has been lost. There's no savior or available magical being to recognize my mother's ghost in my prose and be moved to reverse entropy. The only person who can see this loss for what it is and properly grieve it is me. 

> For sailors aboard ships in storms, the expression “Hold Fast” holds meaning of life and death. Whether one had the strength to maintain grip of the helm or rigging was decisive.

> HOLD FAST as a tattoo is usually applied to the knuckles as a blessing to and a reminder that, whatever the hardships: hanging on is the definition of survival.

- *Unknown* 

Last Christmas, the sound of a raging windstorm died down to a whispering breeze. Waves ceased slamming into the hull of my boat. The ringing in my ears lasted for days, and the contrast between states made me newly ill. 

Within a week or two, it became possible to be still for the first time in my life. I mean this as literally as possible while using a metaphor to describe it.

Now that I know what calm water looks like, I am able to better understand what came before: I hadn't been imagining the conditions. I wasn't wrong that my situation was abnormally bad and that I was holding on for dear life the whole time. I couldn't figure out why the other boats seemed not to be getting tossed around as much as I was. They couldn't understand why I was in such distress when the weather seemed to be just fine. 

Somehow we all failed to notice that I was sailing in an entirely different Sea.

I want to pay a moment's gratitude to the person who made it possible for me to finally scrutinize my adoption as a possible source of my pain. It happened by way of a well-timed, unexpectedly kind comment from a friend named Storm. What maybe would appear as a small act of basic humanity on their part had a massive impact.

---

Looking back threatens to steal focus. I almost died (several times) without ever experiencing calm water: even as the source of hurt stood in the middle of my life howling and thrashing every day for literal decades. The answers were right in front of me. They were also available in book form.

An important realization derived from this change is that these stories are mine. They are what I was handed in exchange for wholeness and peace in a trade I never consented to make. Nothing less than wholeness restored (plus interest) amounts to a good trade. In conclusion, they are priceless artifacts.

They exist and are real whether or not I acknowledge or describe them them. 

The following stories are me. I leave traces of them on everything I touch. 

Like the antique objects I find and restore; they tend to be quirky and misshapen. Many bear signs of lovingly-executed repairs which at the same time take care to preserve as much of the original material and appearance as possible. They are pulled from rubble and arranged by hands which have spent a lifetime extracting beauty from that which is discarded. 

This is the practice which lies close to the core of me. It defines how I move through the world. It is the Art which I honor and live. I accept this process as my sacred duty, and it no longer feels urgent that I offer justification for it. 

There is an unprecedented sense of safety, wholeness, and gratitude to hearing myself say (and believe) that I don't owe the stories, or any other part of me, to anyone, but the truth of this stands with a few notable exceptions: namely three people for whom these stories are already written into their blood.

For better or worse, this history belongs to me. Through me it belongs to them. ❤️‍🩹
